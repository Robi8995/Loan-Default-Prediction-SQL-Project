## üéØ Project Objective

**Objective:** Assess loan portfolio risk, identify high-risk borrowers, and analyze financial exposure across different risk segments to minimize default rates.

**Database:** `loan_db` | **Industry:** Banking & Financial Services

**Problem Statement:**  
Banks face portfolio risk from borrowers likely to default on loans, leading to capital losses, revenue impact, and regulatory challenges. This project provides data-driven risk assessment, early warning systems, and portfolio segmentation strategies to minimize defaults and optimize lending decisions.

## üìä Key Analysis Steps

### 1. **Database Setup**
- Create database and loans table with comprehensive borrower and loan attributes
- Define PRIMARY KEY on loan_id for data integrity
- Set DECIMAL(12,2) for financial precision on income and loan amounts

### 2. **Overall Loan Default Rate**
- Analyze distribution of loans by repayment history (Good, Average, Poor)
- Calculate percentage breakdown of loan performance
- Identify portfolio health and default probability
- Flag borrowers requiring intervention

### 3. **High-Risk Borrowers Identification**
- Identify credit scores below 600 OR poor repayment history
- Flag borrowers with lowest credit scores for priority monitoring
- Create watchlist of 150 high-risk accounts
- Support proactive collection and intervention strategies

### 4. **Risk Segmentation by Credit Score**
- Categorize borrowers into Low (‚â•750), Medium (600-749), High (<600) risk tiers
- Use CASE statements for risk classification
- Quantify borrower distribution by risk segment
- Identify concentration in each risk tier

### 5. **Average Loan Amount by Risk Category**
- Compare loan sizes across Low, Medium, High risk segments
- Identify financial exposure per borrower segment
- Assess risk mitigation through conservative loan sizing
- Determine if lending policy matches risk profile

### 6. **Loan Amount vs Risk Category**
- Aggregate total loan amounts by risk tier
- Calculate average loan amounts per segment
- Determine portfolio concentration risk
- Identify rebalancing opportunities

## üìà Key Findings

### Overall Portfolio Health

| Repayment Status | Total Loans | Percentage |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Good | 786 | 78.60% |
| Average | 204 | 20.40% |
| Poor | 10 | 1.00% |

**Insight:** Strong majority (78.60%) with good repayment history indicates sound underwriting and healthy portfolio fundamentals.

### Risk Segmentation by Credit Score

| Risk Category | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Medium Risk | 594 | 59.4% |
| Low Risk | 272 | 27.2% |
| High Risk | 134 | 13.4% |

**Insight:** Medium risk represents 59.4% of portfolio - largest segment requiring proactive monitoring and intervention.

### Financial Exposure by Risk Category

| Risk Category | Total Loans | Total Amount | Avg Loan Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Low | 845 | $110,425,029 | $130,680.51 |
| Medium | 153 | $11,286,491 | $73,767.92 |
| High | 2 | $154,305 | $77,152.50 |

**Insight:** Conservative lending strategy - high-risk borrowers receive smaller loans (avg $77K vs $131K for low-risk).

### High-Risk Borrowers Profile (150 records)

- **Lowest credit score:** 415 (Jack King) - extreme risk indicator
- **Poor repayment history:** 10 borrowers - immediate intervention required
- **Average income:** 52% below portfolio average
- **Loan amounts:** Conservative sizing evident across high-risk segment
- **Credit score range:** 300-599 for high-risk classification

### Portfolio Risk Insights

- **Concentration Risk:** Only 0.14% of total portfolio value in high-risk category
- **Quality Assessment:** 78.60% good payment history demonstrates effective risk selection
- **Exposure Control:** Average high-risk loan is 41% lower than low-risk
- **Medium Risk:** Largest intervention opportunity with 204 average-paying borrowers

               WHEN credit_score >= 750 THEN 'Low Risk'
               WHEN credit_score BETWEEN 600 AND 749 THEN 'Medium Risk'
               ELSE 'High Risk'
           END AS risk_category
    FROM loans
